# Markup Syntax
Tag                                          | Description
-------------------------------------------- | ---------------
`[imdb:id(tt0000000)]`                       | Set the current movie. All tags starting with `[imdb` use this id. This ID disappearance when you **save** the post into your database.
`[imdblive:id(tt0000000)]`                   | Set the current movie. All tags starting with `[imdblive` use this id. This ID disappearance when you **read** the post from your database.
`[imdb:cast]` `[imdblive:cast]`              | A list of main actors. *<br />Example:<br />[Elijah Wood](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704) Frodo Baggins<br />[Ian McKellen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005212) Gandalf the Grey<br />[Orlando Bloom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089217) Legolas Greenleaf<br />[Sean Bean](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000293) Boromir*
`[imdb:certificate]` `[imdblive:certificate]`| Various countries or regions have film classification boards for reviewing movies and rating their content in terms of its suitability for particular audiences. For many countries, movies are required to be advertised as having a particular "certificate" or "rating", forewarning audiences of possible "objectionable content". The nature of this "objectionable content" is determined mainly by contemporary national, social, religious, and political standards. The usual criteria which determine a film's certificate are violence and sexuality, with "mature" (adult) situations and especially blasphemy and political issues often being considered more important outside the Western world. This is by no means a hard and fast rule; see the Hays Production Code for an example. In some cases, a film classification board exhibits censorship by demanding changes be made to a movie in order to receive a certain rating. As many movies are targetted at a particular age group, studios must balance the content of their films against the demands of the classification board. Negotiations are common; studios agree to make certain changes to films in order to receive the required rating. The IMDb uses the term "Certificate" as opposed to "Rating" to avoid confusion with "ratings" meaning the opinions of critics. <http://www.filmratings.com> Classification and Rating Administration (CARA)*<br /><br />Example: Fight Club has certificate **PG** on english WordPress and **15** on swedish WordPress*
`[imdb:date]` `[imdblive:date]`              | The day when a movie is shipped to exhibitors by the distributor, it is deemed to have been released for public viewing - there are no longer any studio restrictions on who can see the movie. If no release date is given as used publication year.*<br /><br />Example: The Dark Knight has release date **2008-07-18** english WordPress and **2008-07-25** on swedish WordPress*
`[imdb:directors]` `[imdblive:directors]`    | The principal creative artist on a movie set. A director is usually (but not always) the driving artistic source behind the filming process, and communicates to actors the way that he/she would like a particular scene played. A director's duties might also include casting, script editing, shot selection, shot composition, and editing. Typically, a director has complete artistic control over all aspects of the movie, but it is not uncommon for the director to be bound by agreements with either a producer or a studio. In some large productions, a director will delegate less important scenes to a second unit.*<br /><br />Example: Director of Pan's Labyrinth is **[Guillermo del Toro](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219)***
`[imdb:genres]` `[imdblive:genres]`          | One or more genres for current movie. <http://www.imdb.com/genre> IMDb list of all genres.*<br />Example: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has genres: **Action, Adventure, Fantasy***
`[imdb:plot]` `[imdblive:plot]`              | A plot summary is a description of the story in a novel, film or other piece of storytelling. It is not a review and should not contain the opinions of the author. It should contain all the necessary information about the main characters and the unfolding drama to give a complete impression of the twists and turns in the plot, but without confusing the reader with unnecessary detail.*<br /><br />Example: Les quatre cents coups has plot: **Intensely touching story of a misunderstood young adolescent who left without attention, delves into a life of petty crime.***
`[imdb:poster]` `[imdblive:poster]`          | Current movie poster image.*<br />Example: <http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNTYzMzE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5Mzg3OA@@._V1_.jpg><br />*<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523" title="Fight Club"><img src="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjIwNTYzMzE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5Mzg3OA@@._V1_.jpg" alt="Fight Club" height="200"/></a>
